Vim configuration
============

Installed plugins
------------

**pathogen.vim**

Manage your 'runtimepath' with [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). In practical terms, pathogen.vim makes it super easy to install plugins and runtime files in their own private directories.

**NERD Tree**

The [NERD Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) allows you to explore your filesystem and to open files and directories. It presents the filesystem to you in the form of a tree which you manipulate with the keyboard and/or mouse. It also allows you to perform simple filesystem operations.

    Ctrl+N - Toogle NERD Tree

**MRU**

The Most Recently Used (MRU) plugin provides an easy access to a list of 
recently opened/edited files in Vim. This plugin automatically stores the 
file names as you open/edit them in Vim.

    Ctrl+M - Open recently used files

**Conque**

[Conque](http://code.google.com/p/conque/) is a Vim plugin which allows you to run interactive programs, such as bash on linux or powershell.exe on Windows, inside a Vim buffer. In other words it is a terminal emulator which uses a Vim buffer to display the program output.

    :ConqueTerm bash
    :ConqueTerm mysql -h localhost -u joe_lunchbox Menu
    :ConqueTerm Powershell.exe

**rails.vim**

[rails.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails)
